# Path to DevOps Engineering

## Introduction

Welcome to my **Path to DevOps Engineering** repository! This project documents my journey to becoming a DevOps engineer, highlighting the skills and concepts I've learned through various resources, including the **Code and Co.** course.

## Cover Letter / Pathway Explanation

Throughout this journey, I will demonstrate the skill sets I have developed over the past few months while completing the **Code and Co.** course, which provides a structured pathway into **DevOps engineering**.

As part of this course, I will explore a range of essential topics, each organized into dedicated directories. These include **Linux fundamentals**, **Bash scripting**, **Git**, **networking**, **Docker**, **AWS**, **Terraform**, **CI/CD**, and **Kubernetes**â€”key areas crucial for building a strong foundation in DevOps.

By applying the knowledge gained from these subjects, I aim to develop hands-on experience that will prepare me for real-world challenges. This process will help me proactively address challenges encountered in a day-to-day DevOps role, equipping me with the necessary skills to transition into a junior DevOps engineer position with confidence.
