# 🌩️ AWS (Amazon Web Services) Overview

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud computing platform that offers on-demand access to computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, and networking. It empowers businesses—ranging from startups to enterprises—to build scalable, secure, and highly available applications globally.

---

## 🚀 Why AWS?

- **Scalability:** Easily scale applications up or down based on demand.
- **Security:** Industry-leading compliance and security measures.
- **Global Reach:** Deploy services closer to your users with global infrastructure.
- **Pay-as-you-go:** Only pay for what you use.
- **Reliability:** Redundant systems ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

---

## ✅ Common Use Cases

- **Network Services:** VPCs, subnets, security groups, and routing control.
- **Compute Services:** Launch virtual machines (EC2) to run applications.
- **Database Hosting:** Manage structured or unstructured data via services like RDS, DynamoDB, and Aurora.
- **Content Delivery:** Distribute content efficiently using CloudFront CDN.
- **Serverless Applications:** Build with Lambda for scalable, event-driven architectures.

## 🌍 AWS Global Infrastructure

### 📍 Regions

AWS Regions are geographical areas that consist of multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones (AZs). Each region is a cluster of data centers providing high availability and fault tolerance.

- Examples: `us-east-1` (N. Virginia), `eu-west-2` (London)

> **Most AWS services are region-scoped.** When you create resources like EC2 or S3, you must choose a region.

#### 🧠 Choosing the Right Region
- ✅ Meets legal and compliance requirements
- 🌍 Close proximity to your user base
- ⚙️ Required services and features are available
- 💸 Competitive pricing

---

### 🧱 Availability Zones (AZs)

Each AWS Region contains multiple AZs (usually 3–6), which are separate data centers with their own power, networking, and cooling.

Example for London Region (`eu-west-2`):
- `eu-west-2a`
- `eu-west-2b`
- `eu-west-2c`

> AZs are connected via low-latency, high-bandwidth networking, allowing you to build **highly available**, **resilient**, and **fault-tolerant** systems.

---

### 🌐 Points of Presence (PoPs)

AWS has **400+ Points of Presence**, including **Edge Locations** and **Regional Edge Caches**.

Used primarily by:
- **Amazon CloudFront (CDN)**
- **Route 53 (DNS)**
- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)**
- **AWS Global Accelerator**

> These allow content to be delivered quickly with **low latency** to users worldwide.
