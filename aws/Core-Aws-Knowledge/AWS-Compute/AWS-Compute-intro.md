# ‚öôÔ∏è AWS Compute Services

Cloud computing is about leveraging remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than relying on local servers or personal machines.

Traditionally, you'd need physical infrastructure ‚Äî racks of servers in data centers ‚Äî to run your application. With AWS, **you focus on your application logic**, and AWS handles the infrastructure, scalability, and high availability.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Compute Options

AWS offers a variety of compute models tailored to different workloads:

| Compute Model      | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** | Virtual machines (VMs) where you control the OS, packages, and configurations. Great for flexibility and custom environments. |
| **Containers: ECS & EKS** | ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a container orchestrator for running Docker containers. EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a managed Kubernetes service for scalable container management. |
| **Serverless: AWS Lambda** | Event-driven compute where you run code without provisioning servers. You only pay for the compute time consumed. Great for short tasks, microservices, and automation. |
| **Batch Computing: AWS Batch** | Efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch processing jobs. Ideal for large-scale data processing. |
| **Edge Computing: AWS Lambda@Edge & CloudFront Functions** | Run functions closer to users at AWS edge locations ‚Äî ideal for low-latency needs like request filtering or A/B testing. |
| **Hybrid Compute: AWS Outposts & Snow Family** | Bring AWS services to your on-premises or disconnected environments. Perfect for regulated industries or edge locations. |

## üîÅ High Availability & Scalability Built-In

All AWS compute services are designed for:

- ‚úÖ **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjust compute capacity to meet demand.
- ‚úÖ **Elasticity**: Scale out (add resources) or scale in (remove resources) as needed.
- ‚úÖ **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic evenly using services like **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**.
- ‚úÖ **Fault Tolerance**: Use **Availability Zones (AZs)** and **Regions** to ensure workloads stay online even if part of the infrastructure fails.

## üìå When to Use What?

| Use Case | Recommended AWS Compute Option |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Full control over OS and environment | **Amazon EC2** |
| Microservices, container-based apps | **Amazon ECS / EKS** |
| Simple functions, automation, backend APIs | **AWS Lambda** |
| Massively parallel batch jobs | **AWS Batch** |
| Run compute closer to end users | **Lambda@Edge, CloudFront Functions** |
| On-premise or hybrid cloud scenarios | **AWS Outposts, Snowball, Snowcone** |

---

## üí° Example Scenarios

- **Web Server Deployment**: Use EC2 or ECS Fargate.
- **CI/CD Build and Test Pipelines**: Use Lambda for webhooks or EC2/ECS for builds.
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Combine S3, Lambda, and Batch for scalable workflows.
- **Machine Learning Model Inference**: Use EC2 GPU instances or Lambda for light models.
- **Video Transcoding**: AWS Lambda for short clips, AWS Batch for longer files.

## üß† Best Practices

- Use **Auto Scaling Groups** to maintain availability and reduce costs.
- **Tag resources** for cost tracking and organization.
- Use **Spot Instances** for cost-effective, interruptible workloads.
- Apply **IAM roles** and **security groups** to isolate and secure your compute resources.
- Prefer **managed services** (ECS Fargate, Lambda, EKS) to reduce operational overhead.
