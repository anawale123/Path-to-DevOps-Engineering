# AWS VPC Flow Logs

VPC Flow Logs capture metadata about the IP traffic going in and out of your VPC. They log information like source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and whether the traffic was accepted or rejected.

## Why Use VPC Flow Logs?

- Monitor network traffic patterns  
- Troubleshoot connectivity issues  
- Detect security threats or unusual behavior  
- Get visibility into how your VPC resources communicate
