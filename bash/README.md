## Bash Scripting

Bash scripting is a fundamental skill in DevOps, enabling automation, system management, and task execution across Linux-based environments. Understanding Bash scripts allows DevOps engineers to streamline workflows, manage files efficiently, and automate repetitive tasks.

In this section of my **Path-to-DevOps-Engineering** repository, I focus on Bash scripting fundamentals, covering key concepts such as arithmetic operations, file handling, conditional statements, and backup automation. These practical tasks reinforce my understanding of scripting in real-world DevOps scenarios.

| **Labs**               | **Description**                                                                                                  | **Status** |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Basic Arithmetic**    | A script that takes two numbers as input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), displaying the results. | âœ…         |
| **File Operations**     | A script that creates a directory, navigates into it, creates a file, writes text into it, and displays its contents. | âœ…         |
| **Conditional Statements** | A script that checks if a file exists and prints whether it is readable, writable, or executable.               | âœ…         |
| **Backup Script**       | A script that copies all `.txt` files from a specified directory to a backup directory, creating it if it doesn't exist. | âœ…         |

By building a strong foundation in Bash scripting and exploring more advanced concepts, Iâ€™m taking an essential step in my DevOps journey. These hands-on tasks have given me practical experience in automation, file handling, and system operations, enabling me to lay a solid foundation in Bash, which is a key skill for real-world DevOps environments.

As I continue refining my scripting abilities and integrating them with other DevOps tools, Iâ€™ll be better equipped to automate workflows and optimize processes efficiently.
