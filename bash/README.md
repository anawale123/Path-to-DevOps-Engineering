🐚 Bash Scripting
Bash scripting is a fundamental skill in DevOps, enabling automation, system management, and task execution across Linux-based environments. Understanding Bash scripts allows DevOps engineers to streamline workflows, manage files efficiently, and automate repetitive tasks.

This section of my Path-to-DevOps-Engineering repository focuses on Bash scripting fundamentals, covering key concepts such as arithmetic operations, file handling, conditional statements, and backup automation. These practical tasks reinforce my understanding of scripting in real-world DevOps scenarios.

🎯 Objectives
Task	Description	Status
Basic Arithmetic	A script that takes two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, displaying the results.	✅
File Operations	A script that creates a directory, navigates into it, creates a file, writes text into it, and displays its contents.	✅
Conditional Statements	A script that checks if a file exists and prints whether it is readable, writable, or executable.	✅
Backup Script	A script that copies all .txt files from a specified directory to a backup directory, creating it if it doesn't exist.	✅
🚀 Reflection
By building a strong foundation in Bash scripting and exploring more advanced concepts, I’m taking an essential step in my DevOps journey. These hands-on tasks have given me practical experience in automation, file handling, and system operations—helping me lay a solid foundation in Bash, which is a key skill in real-world DevOps environments.

As I continue refining my scripting abilities and integrating them with other DevOps tools, I’ll be better equipped to automate workflows and optimize processes efficiently.
