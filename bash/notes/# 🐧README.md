## üîß Importance of Linux in DevOps Engineering

One of the key responsibilities in DevOps engineering is **automating tasks** within an operating system. Since **Linux** is widely used across servers and cloud platforms, it provides engineers with:

- Greater technical control  
- Enhanced security  
- Flexible file and system management  
- Stricter permission settings and security protocols  

Understanding Linux‚Äîboth fundamentals and advanced topics‚Äîhelps engineers manipulate files, manage processes, and automate workflows within complex environments. This foundational knowledge is critical for building **scalable, secure infrastructure** in a DevOps role.

## üìö Linux Fundamentals and Advanced Concepts

### üß± Fundamentals

| Topic                      | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Navigating the Filesystem**   | Use `cd`, `ls`, `pwd` to move around and explore the Linux directory structure |
| **Managing Files & Permissions**| Work with `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`, `chmod`, and `chown` to manage files and access |
| **Working with Text**           | Tools like `cat`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `echo`, and `sort` for searching and editing |
| **Basic Networking Commands**   | Use `ping`, `ifconfig`, `netstat`, and `ssh` to check connectivity and access servers |
| **Compression & Archiving**     | Use `tar`, `gzip`, and `zip` to compress and archive files for transfer or storage |

### üîê Advanced Concepts (Security & Automation)

| Topic                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **File Permissions & `sudo`** | Set secure file permissions and execute tasks with root privileges using `sudo` |
| **SSH & Key Management**      | Create and manage SSH keys for secure, passwordless server access          |
| **Encryption & Decryption**  | Use tools like `gpg` to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data                  |
| **Advanced Networking**       | Tools like `nmap`, `netcat`, and SSH tunneling for security and diagnostics  |

## üéÆ How Will I Learn These?

To strengthen my Linux skills, I‚Äôll be completing the **Bandit game** from [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/), progressing from **Level 0 to 20**.

This hands-on game will help me:

- Learn Linux commands by solving real-world challenges  
- Practice file permissions, user access, and process management  
- Understand secure remote connections and file manipulation
