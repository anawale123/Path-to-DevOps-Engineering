# Docker Registry

A **Docker registry** is a system that stores and distributes Docker images. It allows developers to **push** (upload) and **pull** (download) container images for deployment or collaboration.

## Types of Docker Registries

**Public Registry (e.g., Docker Hub)**  
- Anyone can pull images without authentication.  
- Ideal for **open-source projects** and sharing with the community.

**Private Registry (e.g., AWS ECR, GitHub Container Registry)**  
- Requires login and access control.  
- Used in **enterprise environments** for security and controlled distribution.
