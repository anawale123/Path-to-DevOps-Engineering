# Computer Networks Notes  

Computer networks: are group of computers that share information and resources through connection. Devices talk to each other because they are linked by a network.

## LAN (Local Area Network)  
- LAN is local, connects devices close together (home, office, school).  
- Devices connect through router or switch.  
- Example: printing from phone → phone sends request → router forwards → printer gets it.  
- LAN is all about fast, local communication.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)  
- WAN connects multiple LANs over big distances.  
- Internet is the biggest WAN.  
- WAN makes it possible for people in different cities/countries to communicate.

## Core Network Devices  

**Switch**  
- Used inside LAN.  
- Forwards data to correct device using MAC address.  
- Stops sending data to everyone, so less congestion and smoother flow.  

**Router**  
- Connects LAN to the internet through ISP.  
- Routes traffic between LAN and WAN.  
- Can link multiple LANs together.  

**Firewall**  
- Security for your network.  
- Monitors traffic in and out.  
- Blocks suspicious stuff and denies unauthorized access.

## IP Addressing  

Every device needs an IP address (like an ID so devices can find each other).  

- **Home networks**: router gives private IP to each device, ISP gives public IP to router.  
- **Mobile devices**: mobile network gives temporary IP when you connect.  
- **Websites/servers**: usually have static (permanent) IP so they are always reachable. DNS translates domain names into these IPs.

## Quick Recap  
- LAN = local network (home, office).  
- WAN = wide/global network (internet).  
- Switch = forwards data in LAN with MAC addresses.  
- Router = connects networks and gets internet.  
- Firewall = blocks bad traffic, secures network.  
- IP = unique ID so devices can talk to each other.
