# 🌐 Computer Networks

A computer network is a group of connected devices that share information and resources. Understanding how these components interact is essential for anyone in IT, particularly DevOps engineers who manage infrastructure, security, and connectivity.

## 📡 Key Concepts

### 🔹 LAN (Local Area Network)
A LAN connects devices within a limited area such as a home, office, or building via a router.  
**Example:** Printing from a mobile device to a printer—data is sent from the phone to the printer through the router.

### 🔹 WAN (Wide Area Network)
A WAN connects multiple LANs over large geographical distances, enabling communication across cities, countries, or globally.

### 🔹 Switch
A switch operates within a LAN and forwards data based on MAC addresses. It improves efficiency by sending data only to the intended recipient, reducing unnecessary traffic.

### 🔹 Router
Routers connect multiple networks and manage traffic between them. They provide internet access by routing data between local devices and the Internet Service Provider (ISP).

### 🔹 Firewall
A firewall acts as a security gatekeeper. It monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic, blocking unauthorized access while allowing trusted communication.
