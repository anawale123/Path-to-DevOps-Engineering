# Subnetting Basics

Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network (IP address block) into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets). It’s all about breaking big networks into smaller chunks to make life easier.

## Benefits of Subnetting

- **Better network management:** Smaller subnets are easier to organize and monitor.  
- **Improved security:** You can isolate devices or departments into separate subnets.  
- **Efficient IP address usage:** Assign only the number of addresses you need per subnet.  
- **Reduced network congestion:** Limits broadcast domains, keeping traffic more contained.

## Binary Basics

Subnetting works heavily with binary numbers, so you need to understand how to convert binary ↔ decimal.

Each digit (bit) represents an increasing power of 2:
