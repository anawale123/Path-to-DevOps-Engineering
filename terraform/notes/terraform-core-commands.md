# Terraform Core Commands

This guide covers the essential Terraform commands you will use to **initialize, plan, apply, destroy, and manage infrastructure**, along with some additional useful commands for daily Terraform work.

---

## terraform init
This is the first command you run in a Terraform project.  
It sets up your workspace by:

- Initializing the backend (where the state file is stored).  
- Downloading required providers.  
- Preparing the project for further Terraform operations.

**Usage:**
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
Previews the changes Terraform will make before they happen.

Compares the current state with your desired state in configuration files.

Shows a detailed execution plan, including resources that will be added, updated, or destroyed.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
terraform apply
Applies the execution plan generated by terraform plan.

Creates, updates, or deletes resources to match your desired state.

Updates the state file after changes are applied.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
You can also combine with auto-approval to skip confirmation:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform destroy
Deletes all the resources defined in your Terraform configuration.

Previews which resources will be destroyed.

Prompts for confirmation before actually deleting anything.

Updates the state file to remove destroyed resources.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
terraform validate
Validates the syntax and configuration of your Terraform files without touching any real infrastructure.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
terraform validate
terraform fmt
Automatically formats your Terraform code according to standard style conventions.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
terraform fmt
terraform output
Displays the output values defined in your configuration (outputs.tf).
Useful to get information like resource IDs, IP addresses, or URLs after a deployment.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
terraform output
To get a specific output:

bash
Copy code
terraform output vpc_id
terraform import
Brings existing resources under Terraform management.

Terraform will track an existing cloud resource in the state file.

Useful for managing infrastructure not originally created with Terraform.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
terraform import aws_vpc.main vpc-123456
terraform state
Commands to inspect or modify the Terraform state file.
Examples:

List resources in the state:

bash
Copy code
terraform state list
Show details of a specific resource:

bash
Copy code
terraform state show aws_vpc.main
terraform taint / untaint
Manually marks a resource to be recreated on the next apply.

Taint:

bash
Copy code
terraform taint aws_instance.web
Untaint:

bash
Copy code
terraform untaint aws_instance.web
terraform refresh
Updates the state file to match the real-world infrastructure without changing any resources.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
terraform refresh
